Battlefield Seeding Tool

Coded by Brad Rhodes based on the idea of a previous tool by Tim Froehlich (Avatar2453, Avatar_Ko, Advacar, etc)

Goal: This windows application was made to automate seeding of Battlefield Servers. It will:

Join a server automatically if there are less than the minimum number of players in the server, leave the server automatically if there are more than the maximum number of players in the server.
